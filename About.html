  <h1>Tarak Katoch</h1>
<h5>Student at UPES</h5>
<p>Hey there,

    I'm Tarak Katoch, a Computer Science undergrad with a major in cloud computing and virtualisation. Right now, I'm deep into building something cool -a SaaS project, an e-commerce platform all about dogs named PawKart! Yep, you heard that right -dog products galore.
    <br>
    <br>
    But that's not all I'm about. I live for the thrill of diving into AI and ML, always on the lookout for the next big thing. And hey, when it comes to getting down and dirty with data, SQL and Python are my go-to tools. I also know the basics of AWS, leveraging its scalable and cost-effective cloud computing solutions to bring my projects to life.
    <br>
    <br>
    When I'm not lost in the world of coding and algorithms, you'll likely find me on the basketball court, chasing that sweet victory with my team. And when wanderlust kicks in, I'm off exploring new places, soaking in the vibes and cultures around me.
    <br>
    <br>
    Life's too short to stick to the script, right? So, here's to coding, hoops, and endless adventures!
    <br>
    <br>
    Catch you on the flip side,
     </p>
